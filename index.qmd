Here's a template I made for easily making your own personal website with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). This is not meant to be exhaustive, rather a quick guide to get you up and running with your own free custom website, especially if you're unfamiliar with coding. To use this template, follow these simple steps:

## 1. Make a [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account {.lefth}

## 2. Fork the repo by clicking [here](https://github.com/rsenft1/quarto-website-template/fork). {.lefth}

Forking is like making a copy you can modify for your own purposes. You can also go to the [Github repo](https://github.com/rsenft1/quarto-website-template), sign in, and click the fork button shown below:

# 2. Rename your repo

Go to the "Settings :gear:" tab on your fork of the repo. Then change the name to something that makes sense to you. I'd recommend `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io` because this is a 'freebie' GitHub gives you that can become the URL when you deploy. Otherwise, you'll get a pretty random URL like 'secretseaweed'.github.io or something similarly random.

# 3. Customize your website

For this, I would recommend you download and install [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ "RStudio") and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ "Quarto") as it will make rendering the website to see your effects much easier, but strictly speaking, you can make these changes on GitHub using the built-in text editor.

I also highly recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/ "GitHub Desktop") to manage your repo. Right now, your files exist online only, but to make changes using RStudio, you need to download a copy of the repo to your local computer (this is also called cloning). Then after you make changes you must sync your files back up with the version on GitHub. This process has two steps: a saving step where you make a "commit" and a step where you overwrite the old version of your document with the new version, which is called making a "push."

In this section, I will describe the major things you'd want to change about the template website and how to go about making these changes using the website files.

1.  **Update your website name, description, footer**

2.  **Choose a profile picture, logo, and favicon**

    There are a few main images on the website: 1) a profile picture on the main home page called `profile.png`, 2) a logo that is present in the upper left of every page called `logo.png` and 3) a favicon, which is the small icon you see in the tab if you open the website in a web browser.

    Right now, the image for the logo, profile picture, and favicon are all of my late cat Chicken. To make them your own, simply overwrite these images with your own images that have the same name. Note that there isn't any special cropping here. If you want your image to be circular, crop it first (e.g., using Preview's ellipse selection tool, then Crop).

3.  **Add links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and other social media accounts**

4.  **Add your CV**

5.  **Add a portfolio of images**

6.  **Choose your own font and colors**

# 4. Deploy your website for free using GitHub pages
